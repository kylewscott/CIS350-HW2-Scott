### Technical Background
'''
    I have been programming since highschool which inspired me
    to go into computer science and continue programming in
    college. I enjoy learning new technologies and working 
    on projects, I have completed a few AI game projects for 
    classes and on my own which I enjoyed. I am currently working 
    on gaining a better understanding of machine learning by working
    with the mnist dataset to create a digit recognition program.
